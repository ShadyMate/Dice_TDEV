Have you heard of the game "electrons around the cores"? I'm not allowed to give you 
the complete rules of the game, just so much:

The game is played with 4 to 6 dice, so you get an array of 4 to 6 numbers, each 1-6
The name of the game is important
You have to return the correct number five times in a row and your solution is 
considered to be correct

If you just call "submit", you'll get an array and the expected value!

Here are some input/output pairs for you to wrap your mind around:

[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] -> 6
[ 2, 2, 3, 3 ] -> 4
[ 6, 6, 4, 4, 1, 3 ] -> 2
[ 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2 ] -> 12

1. Write failing test for [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] -> 6. (Luis)
2. Write Prod code to pass the test (Niklas)
3. Refactor the code (Luis)
5. Write failing test for [ 2, 2, 3, 3 ] -> 4. (Niklas)
6. Write Prod code to pass the test (Luis)
7. Refactor the code (Niklas)
8. Write failing test for [ 6, 6, 4, 4, 1, 3 ] -> 2. (Luis)
9. Write Prod code to pass the test (Niklas)
10. Refactor the code (Luis)
11. Write failing test for [ 3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2 ] -> 12. (Niklas)
12. Write Prod code to pass the test (Luis)
13. Refactor the code (Niklas)
